## Introduction
Data centers have become essential to support the massive computational requirements of large language models (LLMs). As demand grows, so does the need for scalability in these data centers. However, with greater scalability comes increased complexity in managing such facilities. For example, CINECAâ€™s Leonardo supercomputer consists of approximately 5,000 compute nodes and millions of sensors, all within a single facility. To address these challenges, data centers rely on Operational Data Analytics (ODA) practices, which provide insights to streamline management and ensure efficient performance at scale.

Operational Data Analytics (ODA) consists of two main components:

1. **Collection of Telemetry Data**: This involves gathering detailed telemetry data from the facility, including metrics from compute nodes, sensors, and other critical infrastructure.

2. **Monitoring Framework**: This component focuses on analyzing the collected data and providing visualizations to support informed decision-making and ensure efficient facility management.
The following figure outlines the typical data center facility with ODA:

## Problem Statement
Current approaches in data center and HPC data monitoring typically rely on NoSQL databases due to their scalability and ability to handle diverse data sources. However, this approach often results in telemetry data lacking a defined structure and relationships between different data sources. The absence of a clear structure requires domain knowledge of both the data center infrastructure and the collected data to manage it effectively. Furthermore, variability in data management practices across different data centers adds another layer of complexity to data analysis and interpretation.
